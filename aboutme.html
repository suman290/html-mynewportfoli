<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Suman Gaire, a 19-year-old Nepalese student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business 
Economics with Marketing at the University of Dundee. I'm deeply passionate about my studies, particularly 
the intersection of economics and marketing, and spend much of my time diving into course-related materials. 
I also enjoy reading manga, light novels, and occasionally books on self-discipline. In my free time, I love 
playing football and volleyball, as they keep me active and help me balance my academic commitments with my personal interests.</p>

<p>I have hands-on experience in business operations, marketing, and customer service, which I gained through both virtual 
internships and part-time jobs. Currently, I work as a Customer Service Representative at Rama Thai Dundee, where I handle 
customer interactions, resolve issues, and analyze feedback to drive improvements. Previously, I worked as a cashier at McDonald's 
in Tokyo, where I trained new employees, managed customer transactions, and collaborated with team members to ensure seamless 
operations. These experiences have sharpened my problem-solving, communication, and data analysis skills, and helped me excel 
in fast-paced environments.</p>

<p>In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I am always eager to learn new skills 
and explore different interests. I am proficient in Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, SQL, and Python, 
which helps me with data analysis and project management tasks. I also enjoy programming, e-sports, 
and traveling, as they allow me to challenge myself and broaden my perspective. Fluent in both English 
and Nepali, I am constantly seeking opportunities to grow and contribute to collaborative, innovative environments.</p>
